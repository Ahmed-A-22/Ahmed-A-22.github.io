      <h1>ShareAware</h1>
      <h2>Consent-Driven, Contextual Identity Sharing Platform</h2>

      <p class="summary">
        ShareAware is a privacy-first identity platform that enables users to
        manage multiple contextual identities and share them with third-party
        services using explicit, per-request consent. The system replaces
        implicit Single-Sign-On with short-lived, cryptographically signed
        tokens that minimise data exposure and provide full auditability.

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>1. Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Most Single-Sign-On systems treat identity as a single, static entity.
        In practice, users present different facets of themselves depending on
        context — professional, personal, or social. Existing federated identity
        solutions frequently expose more data than necessary and rely on
        implicit or persistent consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        ShareAware addresses this gap by introducing contextual identities and a
        consent-driven sharing model that gives users precise control over what
        data is shared, with whom, and for how long.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GOALS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>2. Goals & Design Objectives</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>Support multiple contextual identities per user.</li>
        <li>
          Require explicit, per-request consent before any data is shared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimise data exposure through scoped, short-lived access tokens.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a complete audit trail of all identity sharing events.</li>
        <li>Keep the integration flow simple for third-party services.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SYSTEM OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="section project">
      <h3>3. System Overview</h3>
      <p class="project-description">
        ShareAware acts as a custom Identity Provider (IdP). Third-party
        services redirect users to ShareAware when identity access is requested.
        After authentication, users are shown a clear consent screen that
        displays exactly what identity data will be shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon approval, ShareAware issues a short-lived, single-use, RS256-signed
        JWT. This token can be redeemed by the relying party to retrieve only
        the permitted identity fields. All access is logged and can be reviewed
        or revoked by the user.
      </p>

    <!-- TECH DECISIONS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>4. Key Technical Decisions</h3>

      <h4 class="subheading">Contextual Identity Model</h4>
      <p>
        Users can create multiple identities across contexts (e.g. professional,
        social). Each identity contains optional fields to support data
        minimisation and is protected by a visibility flag to prevent accidental
        disclosure.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subheading">Consent-First Architecture</h4>
      <p>
        Identity data is never shared automatically. Every third-party request
        requires explicit user approval, with a clear breakdown of the fields
        being requested and the service requesting them.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subheading">RS256-Signed, Single-Use Tokens</h4>
      <p>
        Identity access is granted via RS256-signed JWTs that are short-lived,
        non-refreshable, and enforced as single-use. Token reuse, replay, and
        tampering are prevented through server-side validation and logging.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subheading">Secure Token Handoff</h4>
      <p>
        Tokens are delivered to relying parties via HTTPS POST requests rather
        than URL parameters, reducing the risk of leakage through logs, browser
        history, or referrer headers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECURITY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>5. Security & Privacy</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>Stateless authentication using JWTs (no cookies or sessions).</li>
        <li>Explicit consent enforced at both UI and backend levels.</li>
        <li>Short token TTL and single-use enforcement.</li>
        <li>Immutable identity snapshots for auditability.</li>
        <li>Alignment with GDPR principles such as data minimisation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- AUDIT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>6. Auditability & Revocation</h3>
      <p>
        Every consent event generates an immutable snapshot of the shared
        identity data and a corresponding audit record. Users can review past
        access grants and revoke unused tokens at any time, ensuring
        transparency and control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TESTING -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>7. Testing & Evaluation</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>
          Automated API tests covering identity CRUD, consent, and token
          lifecycle.
        </li>
        <li>Negative testing for token replay, tampering, and revocation.</li>
        <li>
          Two rounds of usability testing (SUS), achieving a final mean score of
          <strong>86.07</strong> (excellent usability).
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>8. Challenges & Trade-offs</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>
          Relying parties are not pre-registered, increasing phishing risk.
        </li>
        <li>Token TTL selected pragmatically rather than empirically.</li>
        <li>
          Snapshot design balances audit accuracy against media storage costs.
        </li>
      </ul>
