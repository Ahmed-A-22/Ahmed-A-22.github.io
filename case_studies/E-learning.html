      <h1>Real-Time E-Learning Platform</h1>
      <h2>Live Communication, Role-Based Access, and Course Management</h2>

      <p class="summary">
        A full-stack e-learning platform built with Django and WebSockets,
        enabling teachers and students to interact in real time through chat,
        notifications, and structured course workflows. The system was designed
        with clear role-based access control, modular architecture, and
        production deployment in mind.

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>1. Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Many e-learning platforms provide structured course content but lack
        effective real-time interaction and fine-grained access control.
        Communication is often handled through external tools, leading to
        fragmented workflows and reduced engagement between teachers and
        students.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aimed to design and implement an integrated e-learning
        system that combines course management with real-time communication,
        while enforcing clear role-based permissions and ownership constraints
        across the platform.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- GOALS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>2. Goals & Design Objectives</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>
          Support two explicit user roles (teacher and student) with distinct
          permissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable real-time chat and notifications using WebSocket-based
          communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow teachers to create, manage, and control access to courses and
          learning materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow students to enroll in courses, provide feedback, and interact
          directly with instructors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforce object-level ownership and access control across all
          resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deliver a production-ready system supported by automated testing and
          cloud-based storage.

    <!-- SYSTEM OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="section project">
      <h3>3. System Overview</h3>
      <p class="project-description">
        The platform is implemented as a modular Django application composed of
        dedicated apps for users, courses, chat, notifications, shared
        utilities, and a REST API layer. This separation of concerns improves
        maintainability and allowed each subsystem to be developed, tested, and
        evolved independently.

    <!-- KEY TECH DECISIONS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>4. Key Technical Decisions</h3>

      <h4 class="subheading">Custom User Model and Role Handling</h4>
      <p>
        Rather than relying on Django’s Groups framework, the system implements
        a custom user model with a <code>user_type</code> attribute to
        distinguish between students and teachers. This approach enables
        efficient role checks, simpler queries, and explicit permission logic at
        the view level.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subheading">Explicit View-Level Access Control</h4>
      <p>
        Role-based and object-level permissions are enforced directly within
        views to ensure users can only access or modify resources they own or
        are authorised to interact with. This prevents common issues such as
        students modifying course content or teachers accessing unrelated data.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subheading">Real-Time Features via Django Channels</h4>
      <p>
        Real-time chat and notifications are implemented using Django Channels
        and WebSockets. Messages and notifications are persisted in the
        database, while WebSockets provide immediate delivery to connected
        clients.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subheading">Relational Database Design</h4>
      <p>
        The database schema was designed to satisfy BCNF, using join tables for
        many-to-many relationships such as enrollments. A constrained one-to-one
        chat model was selected to simplify message routing and ensure
        consistent performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECURITY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>5. Security & Access Control</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>Secure authentication using Django’s password hashing.</li>
        <li>CSRF protection and ORM-level safeguards against SQL injection.</li>
        <li>Strict role-based and ownership-based permission checks.</li>
        <li>
          Custom 403 responses to provide meaningful access-denied feedback.
        </li>
        <li>HTTPS enforced in production through the hosting platform.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- REAL TIME -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>6. Real-Time Communication</h3>
      <p>
        The chat system supports private, one-to-one conversations between
        users. A unique constraint ensures that no duplicate chat sessions can
        exist between the same pair of users, while deterministic room naming
        ensures consistent WebSocket connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notifications are delivered in real time and stored persistently,
        allowing users to retrieve, review, or delete them through the REST API.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TESTING -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>7. Testing & Reliability</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>
          A suite of 111 automated tests covering users, courses, chat,
          notifications, and API endpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comprehensive coverage of authentication and permission edge cases.
        </li>
        <li>Validation of notification lifecycles and real-time behaviour.</li>
        <li>
          High confidence in system stability prior to production deployment.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- DEPLOYMENT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h3>8. Deployment & Execution</h3>
      <p>
        The application is deployed on Render with PostgreSQL and Redis in
        production. Static assets are served using Whitenoise, while
        user-uploaded media is stored in Google Cloud Storage. Sensitive
        configuration values are managed via environment variables.

      <h3>9. Challenges & Trade-offs</h3>
      <ul class="project-features">
        <li>Cold-start delays caused by free-tier hosting spin-down.</li>
        <li>
          Chat functionality limited to private conversations rather than group
          discussions.
        </li>
        <li>
          A deliberately minimal UI to prioritise backend correctness and system
          behaviour.
